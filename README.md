# Arkive Core

> Open-source, self-hostable, zero-knowledge encrypted file storage and sharing.

Arkive Core is a privacy-focused file storage platform built around a simple idea:

**Your files should be encrypted before they leave your device.**

Files and sensitive metadata are encrypted client-side. The server stores encrypted blobs and encrypted metadata only. File names, folder names, manifests, thumbnails, and file contents are decrypted client-side after the vault is unlocked.

Arkive Core is designed to provide modern cloud storage functionality while preserving privacy through a zero-knowledge architecture.

## What Makes Arkive Different?

Arkive is built around a simple rule:

> The server should never need access to your data.

| Data | Server Can Read |
|--------|--------|
| File contents | ❌ |
| File names | ❌ |
| Folder names | ❌ |
| File metadata | ❌ |
| Encryption keys | ❌ |
| Upload status | ✅ |
| Storage usage | ✅ |
| Account email | ✅ |

The backend only stores encrypted data and encrypted metadata. Decryption happens entirely on the client after the vault is unlocked.

---

## Architecture

Arkive Core is a server-rendered Go application with client-side cryptography powered by Rust and WebAssembly.

```text
Browser
 ├─ Vault unlock
 ├─ Encrypt files
 ├─ Encrypt metadata
 ├─ Generate trigram search tokens
 └─ Decrypt content
          │
          ▼
Arkive Core API (Go)
          │
          ▼
Storage Provider
(Local / S3-compatible / R2)
```

All encryption and decryption happens on the client after vault unlock.

The backend never receives plaintext file names, folder names, manifests, thumbnails, or file contents.

---

## Privacy-Preserving Search

Arkive supports encrypted file and folder search.

Search tokens are derived client-side from the unlocked vault as 3-character trigrams, then sent to the server as blind lookup tokens. The server never receives plaintext search terms or plaintext filenames.

The backend matches all query trigrams against the indexed tokens, which gives substring-style search behavior while keeping names private.

Like most searchable-encryption systems, token equality patterns may be observable, but plaintext names and search queries remain hidden.

---

## Cryptography

Client-side cryptography is implemented using the Arkive Crypto WebAssembly library.

Algorithms currently used include:

- XChaCha20-Poly1305
- Argon2id
- HKDF-SHA256
- BLAKE3
- SHA-256

Arkive Crypto is available separately and contains implementation details, encryption formats, key derivation logic, and cryptographic documentation.

See:

- Arkive Crypto repository
- `core/web/static/vendor/arkive-crypto/README.md`

---

## Ecosystem

Arkive consists of multiple projects that work together:

- Arkive Core — storage server and web application
- Arkive Crypto — Rust/WASM cryptography library
- Arkive Sync — native synchronization engine (planned)
- Arkive Desktop — desktop application (planned)
- Arkive Mobile — mobile applications (planned)

All projects share the same zero-knowledge architecture and client-side cryptography model.

## Run Locally

Use this for development on your machine.

### Requirements

- Go
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/numanjvd82/arkive.git
cd arkive
```

### Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

For local dev, keep these values:

- `APP_ENV=dev`
- `DATABASE_URL=postgres://devuser:devpassword123!@localhost:5132/arkive_dev?sslmode=disable`
- `COOKIE_SECRET`
- `SESSION_TTL`

### Start PostgreSQL

```bash
docker compose up -d db
```

### Start app

```bash
make dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Deploy on a VPS

Use this path when you want Arkive public on a server.

### 1. Provision server

- Linux VPS
- Docker installed
- Docker Compose installed
- Domain name pointed at VPS IP

### 2. Get code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/numanjvd82/arkive.git
cd arkive
```

### 3. Configure production env

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set these values in `.env`:

- `APP_ENV=prod`
- `BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com`
- `COOKIE_SECRET` to strong random secret
- `SESSION_TTL` to desired duration

Keep PostgreSQL private. App container uses `db:5432` over Docker network.

### 4. Build and start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 5. Open app

Put a TLS reverse proxy in front of port `8080`, and visit the HTTPS domain configured in `BASE_URL`:

```text
https://your-domain.com
```

The app listens on HTTP behind the proxy. Production session cookies require HTTPS.

### 6. Update

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Screenshots

Screenshots and demos will be added as the project evolves.

## Project Goals

Arkive aims to provide a modern, privacy-focused storage platform built around zero-knowledge principles.

The project is designed to be:

- Open source
- Self-hostable
- Privacy-first
- Storage-provider agnostic
- Extensible for future clients and services

Future development may include desktop applications, mobile applications, sync clients, and additional deployment models while preserving the project's zero-knowledge architecture.

---

## Security

Arkive is designed around a zero-knowledge architecture.

However:

- Self-hosted administrators control the infrastructure they deploy.
- Browser security remains important.
- Losing recovery material may permanently lock encrypted data.

Arkive has not yet completed a third-party security audit.

Users should independently evaluate whether Arkive meets their threat model before storing sensitive information.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

Important architectural rules:

- SQL belongs in repositories.
- Services own business logic and transactions.
- Handlers stay thin.
- Zero-knowledge guarantees must be preserved.
- Plaintext file and folder names must never be visible to the backend.
- Storage object names must never be changed during moves or renames.
